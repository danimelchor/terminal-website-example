      <h2>Who created Decentrapass?</h2>
      <p>
        Decentrapass has been coded 100% by me. I had difficulties finding
        qualified people for the project so I decided to take it as a challenge
        to complete the organization's website, web app, mobile app, and
        extension by myself. I will probably try to find other people interested
        in the future but I am currently too busy for this project. I will
        re-start the progress on Sept 2, 2021.

      <h2>What is Decentrapass?</h2>
      <p>
        The best way to learn about Decentrapass is to go to it's organization's
        website. To sum' it up, Decentrapass is a decentralized protocol for
        securely storing passwords inside the Ethereum network. The cyphered
        passwords are stored in a decentralized storage using AES encryption
        (the one used by the U.S. government).
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <h2>Why I created it</h2>
      <p>
        The motivation for this project comes from two sources. First, a family
        member of mine felt uneasy about a company storing all their passwords,
        since this can go bankrupt or have a breach. Secondly, modern and secure
        password managers nowadays cost money. Therefore, I decided to create
        Decentrapass as a way to make sure passwords are never lost (since a
        shutdown in the Ethereum network is very unlikely), and as a free
        password manager (except the small fee for the transaction in Ether).
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <h2>It's features</h2>
      <p>
        The main features Decentrapass offers are the following: secure and
        protected password storage, full control over your passwords, super fast
        and easy to use, easily accessible from a new device, user governance
        for future upgrades/longevity of the project, and full transparency of
        the management and storing of your data.
