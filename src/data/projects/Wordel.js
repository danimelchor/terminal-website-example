      <h2>Why does this exist?</h2>
      <p>
        This year, the game known as Wordle became extremely popular. After
        getting addicted to playing it with some of my friends, I decided to
        take on a challenge of creating my own version of Wordle: "Wordel*".

      <h2>What I used</h2>
      <p>
        This website is mainly built using ReactJS and TypeScript. All the data
        like the list of words, or every days' correct word is stored in the
        frontend. I decided to learn TypeScript for this project since I believe
        it will be useful in the future for bigger and more complex projects.
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <h2>Styling</h2>
      <p>
        For the styling, I have decided to use the pre-built classes TailwindCSS
        offers.
      </p>

      <h2>Programming languages and tools I used</h2>
      <ul>
        <li> - HTML</li>
        <li> - CSS</li>
        <li> - TypeScript</li>
        <li> - ReactJS</li>

  );
