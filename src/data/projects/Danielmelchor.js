      <h2>It's features</h2>
      <p>
        Thanks to this website I am able to group all my social media, projects,
        articles, and ideas in a single place. Here, I have built a blog, a
        detailed project view (like the one you are in right now), and several
        other interactions and visualizations that allow people who are
        interested in what I do to find everything swiftly.

      <h2>What I used</h2>
      <p>
        This website is mainly built using ReactJS. Currently all the data is
        stored in the frontend since it speeds up the process of gathering it,
        and a backend for a simple portfolio is very unnecessary. The website
        uses several modules like react-markdown to display the data, and other
        times I use javascript objects when it makes it simpler/I need a more
        specific UI.
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <h2>Styling</h2>
      <p>
        For the styling, I have decided to use the pre-built classes TailwindCSS
        offers. For the animations and interactive dom elements I have created
        the css from scratch since I found it easier to make everything
        pixel-perfect.
